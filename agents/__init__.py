# Filename: agents/__init__.py
# Description: Makes the 'agents' directory a Python package.
# Version: 1.0 (IGNIS Transmutation - Initial Creation)

# This file can be empty. Its presence signifies that the 'agents' directory
# should be treated as a package, allowing for imports like:
# from agents.orchestrator import Orchestrator
# from agents.specific_agent import SpecificAgent

# You could put package-level imports here if desired, e.g.:
# from .orchestrator import Orchestrator
# from .think_tool import ThinkTool
# ... etc.
# However, for simplicity and explicitness, direct imports in modules using these
# agents are often preferred.
