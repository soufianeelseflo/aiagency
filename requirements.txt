# --- Other Dependencies ---
numpy<1.27.0,>=1.26.4 # Keep
# Removed 'docker' from here; it's a CLI tool, not typically a runtime lib unless specifically used by app code.
# The Dockerfile handles Docker image building. If your Python code *calls* Docker SDK, add 'docker>=7.0.0'.
# For now, assuming it's not a direct Python runtime dependency for the deployed app.
# If DeploymentManager requires it at runtime in the container, add it back:
docker>=7.0.0 # Added back as DeploymentManager uses it.
