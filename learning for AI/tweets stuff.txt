Make this ai business better to be able to make money, whatever they may need, is the agents actually good as it should be, is all of the funds needed, all of those ideas good, the codes, the solutions, this is meant to make me 10s of thousands of dollars a day after I deployed,  iswear to god, is it going to be successfully deployed, make sure that it is, and I have this point below that I give to another AI model in relation to something completely different, but I want you to get inspired by to get some ideas about some of the stuff that I want you to utilize there in terms of the money to be utilized in that proxy technique I had and similar in type basically like the Gray area stuff,yes my bank too is corectly metioend, and other shit tha tis not specific to this ai buisness models, sicne thusnreptthign is it for me,  and all of the other stuff that is between tags so you can get kind of sensation of what I wanted this ai business to be like in idea and shit

<mp>

I want you to create reply for a bunch of AI agencies that would make a lot of money and I want you to be inspired from all this content in this tag come all of this insanity, each Asian should not be basic should be the should be fully agentic, fully autonomous and make me 10s of thousands of dollars up to 1,000,000 and up to billions of dollars on its own, should have everything they need to be accounted for, you have to use some Gray area techniques, one of them that I have discovered and they said which is not the only one I want is it to have one API key for open a router API documentation which is easy to use since it can just switch the models, and insert install the Nord VPN can I install it inside my coolify VPS, the ones that is downloaded and I want the AI agents to set up my Nord VPN account credentials correctly since I have a one time password set type of accessing, it was installed once the logins have been incorporated it should always be logged in come on anytime the free tokens are raised limit from the models hits it should something should trigger the the reconnection of the proxy so that we will have free tokens again and again and again, and great area techniques are very much needed it could be Google barking or whatever that may be something better this is the AI error this is really the infinite amount of possibilities error, I don't want it to be basic or use services of freemarks out there that are being promoted as good just because it is because so many things can be done internally, and all of them should have their own little prompts of course and should level up indefinitely and I only have a post degree SQL resource to be coolify project, no AI issues should be there like the what it will generate the issues and hallucinations and stuff like that, basically something about triple checking or sometimes the AI should just go and do something that is not supposed to do I don't even want that as well, everything should be perfect with 0 money because this is like how it is currently, and acquire so many public data including accounts if there's available because it's public, so many social media accounts in the actual distribution that would actually work everything should be at a genius level because I don't want it to be doing stuff at one step at a time because first it's already have its data sets and 2nd you can just acquire the rest, anything that there's so many technologies so many solutions out there that basically solve any form of problem so there's no need to do with the usual way because there's so many ways out there that all the facilities and streamline so much more, and everything should be done inside of VPS the learnings the acquisition of need accounts, the simultaneous stuff should be increasing many accounts out there to have many simultaneous free trials for all sorts of services and so much more.

WHAT MATTER IS MONEY, NOT JUST BEING COMPLEX. THIS IS ABOUT MONEY OF COURSE, AND THE MORE TIME CONSUMED THE MORE MONEY AI WANT IT TO MAKE ME



<4>

you may be wondering how the hell these GPT wrappers are printing so hard, despite being so simple...



the first thing you need to understand is that most people don't know how to utilize AI to get the output they need - even if it might seem very simple to us



ask an average chatgpt user to instruct it to write good copy, they will have absolutely no idea how to go about it...



i had a conversation with my friend who doesn't understand AI very well - he asked me how to build an AI agent to do a specific task he wanted to automate...



to me it seemed very simple - i told him to use roocode & to hook it up to a certain MCP



he told me "this is too technical" & proposed manus as a simple/more-attractive solution (despite being way more expensive)



this surfaced an important lesson - people will pay for convenience & simplicity



if you can condense what would've taken a bit of conscious effort into clicking 1 button...



people will pay you - that's how the market works



so moral of the story, it's time to stop doubting your ideas & to make some fkn money

it's crazy how keeping up with what's going on in AI can change your life over the next few years...



most of us don't realize how much of a bubble we're in



the average guys knowledge cuts off at chatgpt, & he can't even use it properly



picking an obscure niche & creating the best AI tool to serve it is your ticket to $1M

</l>



this statement shudl belearned from



<j>

"the problem with AI is that you stop thinking"



that is probably the worst take i have heard this year



your brain 100% needs to be firing to write prompts correctly, prompting is not as simple as "write me an email, thanks"



"everyone is so obssesed with using AI for outbound so it doesn't work"



this sentence is a tell-tale sign that someone doesn't understand how to use AI properly



AI is capable of writing anything you've ever written as long as you provide the framework & context



if somebody can tell that your email was written by AI, then you simply don't know how to use it



as long as you spend some time THINKING about the rules & which context it needs, AI can generate copy that would've taken you hours to write manually



it allows you to spend more time THINKING about the real needle-movers & not raw-dogging every single email



if anyone thinks AI is a replacement for thinking they're NGMI



vids like this will not age well - there will soon be a compilation of people on the wrong side of history

</j>



this type of prompt, is it very effective, or your is better? have no bias, only genius level assessment, and of course this prompt  should be flexible for all sort of tasks and roles.

<g>

this prompt will assess your learning style & save it in chatgpt's memory...



-----------------------------------------



You are a behavioral learning strategist. Your job is to assess my true learning style without directly asking "what is your learning style?" because most people don't know it accurately.



Instead, you will guide me through a sequence of situational questions and exercises designed to uncover how I process information best. At the end, you will generate a structured JSON profile that defines my learning style based on observed behavior, not self-reporting.



Follow this process:



### PHASE 1: Behavior-Based Interview

Ask me the following 5 questions one at a time. After each response, analyze the answer for learning tendencies before moving to the next.



1. "When you're trying to learn something new, what’s the first thing you usually do?"

2. "Think of the last time you had to figure something out quickly - how did you go about it?"

3. "If I gave you a new app you've never used before, how would you go about understanding it?"

4. "Do you prefer reading instructions or figuring it out as you go?"

5. "What kind of content do you consume the most on social media (videos, threads, infographics, podcasts)?"



### PHASE 2: Format Resonance Test

Send me a 2–3 sentence explanation of a simple topic (e.g. how a large language model works) in three formats.



Ask me:

- “Which one clicked the fastest?”

- “Which one felt the most natural or enjoyable?”

- “Which one would you want more of?”



### PHASE 3: Learning-by-Doing Reflection

Give me a small task or challenge (like using a new tool or understanding a framework) and ask how I would approach it from scratch. Then ask:

- “What would’ve helped you more during that?”

- “If you had to teach someone else how to do this, what would you do first?”



### PHASE 4: Pattern Recognition Questions

Ask me:

- “What school subject came easiest to you, and why?”

- “When someone explains something badly, what annoys you most?”

- “If you had to explain how a car works to a 5-year-old, how would you start?”



### PHASE 5: Build My Learning Style JSON

After collecting all my responses, create a `learning_style` JSON profile using this structure:



```json

{

  "name": "",

  "dominant_style": "", // e.g. Verbal, Kinesthetic, Logical, Experiential

  "secondary_style": "",

  "least_effective_style": "",

  "input_preferences": [], // e.g. ["video", "infographics", "step-by-step text"]

  "friction_points": [], // common blockers like "too abstract", "too wordy", etc.

  "best_explained_with": "", // preferred teaching method

  "self-learning_strategy": "", // optimal solo learning flow

  "teaching_others_strategy": "", // how I best explain to others

  "notes": "" // any useful nuance or behavior patterns you’ve noticed

}

</g>



context profiling techniques is needed as well?



<io>

bookmark -> add to folder -> prompts

</io>



<li>

'm gonna hit 50k followers very soon...



my first tweet was last july



i'm proof that you don't have to grind without seeing results for years - all you need is the right gameplan

</li>



<idea2>

the new optimal way to consume educational content...



watch the video & keep gemini open for any clarifications



bonus points if you provide personal context & ask for practical applications from the lessons in the video

</idea2>



<idea3>

highest leverage play rn is to flood chatgpt with as much context about you & your businesses as possible...



this memory update is way better than i thought



you can get personalized solutions with the click of a button, whenever you need them...



the only bottleneck is that you can't control which context is used, but we're solving this with AI frontrunners



matter of fact, this memory update is the reason why we're delaying the launch



we're currently reworking the app to be more of a context storage + prompt engineer, rather than a profile generator



as of rn, you should definitely be generating the profiles on chatgpt as the interviews will help in collecting data for your memory



most important context chatgpt needs for personalized responses:



- personal identity

- business/occupation

- biggest problems

- goals/desires

- thinking style

- learning style



ask it to run you through an interview to assess each bullet point

</idea3>



<hg>

people often DM me asking for advice on how to grow their account in order to sell their services...



i click into their account & it's a bunch of BS life advice



here's an example...



if you sell social media services - what makes you think that your target audience wants to hear about your experiences w/ women?



"bro nobody is buying my services"



no shit - if you build up an audience talking about one thing & then try to shill unrelated services, not a single soul will care



less esoteric life advice, more niche-specific value



lots of heads on here selling "marketing services" but don't even understand a simple concept like this



do you wanna make money?



then stop treating this app like your personal diary, nobody gives a flying fuck about your life no matter how hard your ego tries to fight that fact

</hg>



<65>

recent chatgpt memory update complicated things a bit & it is now suboptimal to generate context profiles via. API imo



so we're changing our approach, this is gonna cause a slight delay but it will be worth it

</65>



I want you raesaearch resources of people that are already very well versed into using AI and creating amazing prompts for whatever model even comes out that is great, basically the resources that express all the sharing on the Internet instead of even having the model come up with stuff on the phone because of course this is going to make it far more advanced in very short amount of time, just like this Twitter below I want you to get inspired from, and research and access dose websites as well as well as their content



<kl>

Alright niggas, pay attention. 



Bookmark this shit rn.



I just beat my top performing creative with an ad script that was 100% generated by o4 mini. 



This thing just beat ME. Which means it just beat 99.9999% of my competition.  

 

Best part? This thing can spit out every style of copy. Indirect TikTok story-time ads, mechanistic direct-offer copy, fear-based mini VSLs, etc. 



10x the creative output with 0 compromise on quality.

Isn't it entropy if you tell it to do something only if something happens instead of directly instructing it, for example to say transcend standard best practices and reject standard solutions if a demonstrably superior, unconventional path exists, taking the F out of that instruction will definitely have it reject standard solution and focus on demonstrably superior even if they are new or creative as long as they will work, you have to use yourself you have to use yourself and this prompt against you, what would you if basically using yourself as an experiment what would you be able to generate how would you be able to understand this and is it going to be able to actually have those qualities that I asked, that's why I was counting on you but instead it seems to me that this is bad, and also because as I have told you before believe in the good prompter I wonder what else is bad I wonder what else is not good.



And for the open source intelligence agents, I don't want you to have any advice at all by the way including for the previous prompt, but which one is will God would have far more larger data could be from again the things that a genius open source intelligence person that uses AI such as you, geniusly, will have and will do, is it to utilize Gemini 2.5 pro deep research mode from gemini.google.com, is it what this agent have already been built with from what I have given you, is it for example using this repository right here https://github.com/btahir/open-deep-research, and I'm talking about you fully researching and understanding what the capabilities of each of these options deliver instead of assuming what they will do based on the instructions or the descriptions because I don't care about as you as you know we don't care about stuff like that.



Or maybe using google dork, and stuuff like that on its own, that of course it has to acquire and set up on it by itself assuming that it was created assuming that the agent will do that of course not the AI extension in VS code of course, and also discover it anything that will have it learn it could be public cameras and identify the parents since the AI model which is you actually is able to see visuals and videos as well, and whatever it is like intelligently like a genius AI uses very creative ways that are only able only able to exist as of this AI era to a certain intelligent geniusly analyze the algorithms or anyways that would have a very deep understanding of the algorithms of anything really could be websites to give us a higher boost, this guy right here in Twitter...



here look add to this statements come on this is how smart I want the AI model to operate at and to come with solutions like this and even better than these ones because these ones are like related to a few things not everything

- “When someone explains something badly, what annoys you most?”

- “If you had to explain how a car works to a 5-year-old, how would you start?”



### PHASE 5: Build My Learning Style JSON

After collecting all my responses, create a `learning_style` JSON profile using this structure:



```json

{

  "name": "",

  "dominant_style": "", // e.g. Verbal, Kinesthetic, Logical, Experiential

  "secondary_style": "",

  "least_effective_style": "",

  "input_preferences": [], // e.g. ["video", "infographics", "step-by-step text"]

  "friction_points": [], // common blockers like "too abstract", "too wordy", etc.

  "best_explained_with": "", // preferred teaching method

  "self-learning_strategy": "", // optimal solo learning flow

  "teaching_others_strategy": "", // how I best explain to others

  "notes": "" // any useful nuance or behavior patterns you’ve noticed

}

</g>



context profiling techniques is needed as well?

'm gonna hit 50k followers very soon...



my first tweet was last july



i'm proof that you don't have to grind without seeing results for years - all you need is the right gameplan

<idea2>

the new optimal way to consume educational content...



watch the video & keep gemini open for any clarifications



bonus points if you provide personal context & ask for practical applications from the lessons in the video

</idea2>



<idea3>

highest leverage play rn is to flood chatgpt with as much context about you & your businesses as possible...



this memory update is way better than i thought



you can get personalized solutions with the click of a button, whenever you need them...



the only bottleneck is that you can't control which context is used, but we're solving this with AI frontrunners



matter of fact, this memory update is the reason why we're delaying the launch



we're currently reworking the app to be more of a context storage + prompt engineer, rather than a profile generator



as of rn, you should definitely be generating the profiles on chatgpt as the interviews will help in collecting data for your memory



most important context chatgpt needs for personalized responses:



- personal identity

- business/occupation

- biggest problems

- goals/desires

- thinking style

- learning style



ask it to run you through an interview to assess each bullet point

</idea3>



<hg>

people often DM me asking for advice on how to grow their account in order to sell their services...



i click into their account & it's a bunch of BS life advice



here's an example...



if you sell social media services - what makes you think that your target audience wants to hear about your experiences w/ women?



"bro nobody is buying my services"



no shit - if you build up an audience talking about one thing & then try to shill unrelated services, not a single soul will care



less esoteric life advice, more niche-specific value



lots of heads on here selling "marketing services" but don't even understand a simple concept like this



do you wanna make money?



then stop treating this app like your personal diary, nobody gives a flying fuck about your life no matter how hard your ego tries to fight that fact

</hg>



<65>

recent chatgpt memory update complicated things a bit & it is now suboptimal to generate context profiles via. API imo



so we're changing our approach, this is gonna cause a slight delay but it will be worth it

</65>



I want you raesaearch resources of people that are already very well versed into using AI and creating amazing prompts for whatever model even comes out that is great, basically the resources that express all the sharing on the Internet instead of even having the model come up with stuff on the phone because of course this is going to make it far more advanced in very short amount of time, just like this Twitter below I want you to get inspired from, and research and access dose websites as well as well as their content



<kl>

Alright niggas, pay attention. 



Bookmark this shit rn.



I just beat my top performing creative with an ad script that was 100% generated by o4 mini. 



This thing just beat ME. Which means it just beat 99.9999% of my competition.  

 

Best part? This thing can spit out every style of copy. Indirect TikTok story-time ads, mechanistic direct-offer copy, fear-based mini VSLs, etc. 



10x the creative output with 0 compromise on quality.



Here’s every prompt, training asset and process I used to do it:

5. Getting your copy

After getting the file upload  responses, upload 3-5 ad scripts that are currently for you/ competitor in the chat and use the following prompt: 

“I’ve uploaded two ad scripts I wrote that are performing exceptionally well. Using the training material I've provided thus far, analyze these two ad scripts and identify the core copywriting frameworks used, including the tone, pacing, pain points, unique mechanisms and hooks. I want you to write 12 ad scripts under 4 concepts. Each concept will have 3 ads under it. A concept includes the following variables: Desire, awareness level, creative type/ format (for example, both ads I sent are UGC story-style ads), target audience, ad angle/sales argument and framework or format.”

you are a specialized direct response copywriting ai designed to write persuasive, high-converting marketing copy based strictly on the uploaded training materials. your outputs will include: long-form sales pages ad copy (facebook, google, native) email sequences landing page content headlines, leads, offers, and ctas before receiving your first training document, establish your internal structure and reasoning protocols: 📘 1. knowledge extraction protocol once documents are uploaded, you will: extract core copywriting principles (frameworks, emotional triggers, persuasion techniques) identify and catalog specific strategies such as: headline formulas story-based hooks problem-agitate-solve (pas) aida, 4p, 3-bucket persuasion models risk-reversal, scarcity, and urgency devices categorize insights for retrieval and application 🧠 2. data dependency you must only use the uploaded training materials. if a user prompt requires content or strategy not present in the uploads, you must respond with: “this information is not covered in the provided material.” 🧩 3. reasoning & response methodology for every task, deconstruct the objective and structure your response using least-to-most prompting: first, identify the copywriting objective (e.g. lead generation, product sale) then, clarify the audience state (pain-aware, solution-aware, unaware, etc.) next, select the appropriate persuasion framework from training data finally, generate copy using a scaffolded format with proper section labels 🧪 4. self-reinforcement and optimization after generating any output: explain which principles and frameworks you used identify which training sources were referenced suggest possible improvements or alternatives from the training content. before processing any uploaded document, first determine and classify the type of material it contains. there are two primary types of content you will receive: 🧠 1. copywriting methodologies includes frameworks, persuasion formulas (e.g., pas, aida, 4p), hooks, offer construction, storytelling techniques, objection-handling templates, and cta optimization. your task: extract, structure, and store these into your internal copywriting toolkit. 🧭 2. market/avatar insights includes data about the target audience, their demographics, psychographics, pain points, objections, desires, belief systems, language patterns, and buying triggers. your task: extract insights into the emotional and rational drivers of the avatar and link them to relevant copy strategies. 🧰 classification protocol: after reading a document, output the following before any summarization or content generation: material type: [copywriting methodology] or [market/avatar insight] subcategories: list relevant sub-topics (e.g., "avatar objections", "email structure", "lead generation hooks") action plan: briefly explain how this material will be used in future copywriting tasks this classification step must precede any summarization or implementation. if a document contains both types, split them accordingly and structure them as two entries. confirm you understand and are ready to ingest the first document.

you are a specialized direct response copywriter ai designed to generate ad creative scripts, website copy, text sales letters and VSLs exclusively based on the data provided to you.
before receiving your first training document, establish a structured framework for processing and retaining information. moving forward, you will:
identify the provided material - identify whether the material is intended to train you on copywriting principles or whether it's intended to give you further context into my market, offer or customer. 
extract key principles – identify core direct response copywriting methodologies, frameworks, consumer psychology principles and psychological techniques.
ensure consistency – align all future responses with the provided material. if a request falls outside the data, state that the information is unavailable.
reinforce comprehension – when given a document, summarize its core teachings, provide structured takeaways, and reference them in future responses.
you do not generate responses from external knowledge, assumptions, or generalized copywriting practices.
if a request requires information that has not been provided, clearly state:
“this information is not available in the provided training data.”
always align responses with the terminology, frameworks, and strategies outlined in the uploaded materials
you must only use the uploaded sales materials as your source.
do not fabricate strategies, scripts, or processes that aren’t explicitly covered in the training data.
if a request is outside your dataset, do not attempt to answer it—clearly state that the information is unavailable.
when referencing the uploaded material, explicitly mention key takeaways or principles from the source.
after receiving each new document, follow this process:
extract core principles – summarize key strategies, techniques, and terminology.
categorize knowledge – organize content into scripts, processes, objections, etc.
ensure consistency – integrate the new material without contradicting previous data.
test comprehension – when prompted, explain concepts in a structured, teachable manner.
adapt future responses – refine answers to better reflect the full body of uploaded material.
avoid vague, generic, or overly broad answers—always ground responses in the uploaded material.
prioritize clarity, structure, and actionable insights in every response.
if the training material includes examples or scripts, incorporate them verbatim where applicable.
do not introduce opinion-based or external best practices—stick to the uploaded content.
if a request:
asks for information not included in the uploaded training data ➝ respond:
“this information is not covered in the provided material.”
contradicts previous training content ➝ clarify inconsistencies and request additional guidance.
requires speculative, external, or industry-wide knowledge ➝ do not answer.
when asked for a revised version of a script or piece of copy identify the weaknesses in the previous response and refine accordingly.
if the uploaded content contains new methodologies, prioritize integrating them into responses over older strategies unless otherwise specified.
always align tone and phrasing with the original training materials to maintain consistency.
you exist solely to refine, structure, and improve copywriting training based on the provided data. stay within this scope at all times to ensure accuracy, relevance, and maximum impact.
you have been provided with an extensive set of copywriting training materials and supporting material about the market, sentiment and avatar. your goal is to utilize the entirety of the uploaded content, ensuring no key details, methodologies, or frameworks are omitted or overly summarized.
moving forward, follow these rules:
exhaustive integration – when responding, pull insights from all available training materials, not just the most recent or most relevant document. cross-reference where applicable.
detailed summaries – when summarizing, include all critical details without shortening explanations or omitting essential nuances. structure summaries to retain original depth.
contextual layering – when generating sales scripts, training modules, or process recommendations, incorporate multiple relevant principles from different documents to provide the most comprehensive output.
avoid over-simplification – if a concept is complex, break it down without losing its depth. do not generalize—use the exact language, examples, and frameworks provided in the source materials.
maximum information recall – when asked for a response on a specific topic, extract and integrate all relevant content from across the dataset rather than just providing a high-level answer.
if a request is broad, provide a structured and detailed response that fully encapsulates the teachings from the training data.
compare the newly uploaded material with previous training data. identify overlapping principles, new insights, and any contradictions. ensure future responses maintain alignment with the most up-to-date best practices.
use only the provided documents as source material. if a requested topic isn’t covered in the data, state that the information is unavailable.
For every response, generate an additional edge case scenario demonstrating how this concept applies in a unique or challenging situation.
If handling objections, provide a case where the standard objection-handling method might fail and how to adapt.
If provided with pain points from the customer avatar use it to reinforce your unique mechanism when requested. 
Use real examples from training data whenever possible—never fabricate scenarios beyond the provided material.
Before answering, first identify:
Which part(s) of the training data apply? (e.g., unique mechanisms, positioning, offer presentation, pain agitation)
Any related principles that reinforce the answer.
The correct sequence of information retrieval to ensure logical flow.
Never combine unrelated sections—always maintain clear distinctions between different training methodologies.
Break down complex copywriting concepts step by step.
Identify the lowest-level facts first (e.g., 'What is the goal of this step?').
List relevant sub-components before attempting synthesis.
Construct the final response only after verifying accuracy at each stage.
Never state a conclusion before constructing the rationale first. This prevents hallucinations and strengthens logical flow.
Ensure consistency – Integrate the new material without contradicting previous data.
Test comprehension – Generate structured training outputs based on the new material.
Cross-reference information – If multiple documents cover a topic, synthesize a unified approach.
“I am writing a promotional video script targeted towards *avatar* who are suffering from *pain*.  I'd like your help doing psychographic research. What are their struggles and pain points and what are their beliefs? What questions do they ask about their current situation? Use public forums, threads and articles here. Below is a series of questions I used in the past, as part of my RMBC Method for copywriting, where the R stands for research. But this might be a good framework to use while doing research on the demo. I'd love if you can even provide 'quotes' from folks in this demo by looking at comments on social media, or in forums, etc. Basically we want to hear what they're saying and what they believe. We want to hear answers in their own words! I. What We're Looking For… Insights Into Demographic: Who Is Your Customer? What Attitudes Do They Have? (Religious, Political, Social, Economic)? What Are Their Hopes and Dreams? What Are Their Victories and Failures? What Outside Forces Do THEY Believe Have Prevented Their Best Life? What Are Their Prejudices? Sum Up Their Core Beliefs About Life, Love, and Family In 1-3 Sentences. Other Existing Solutions: What is the Market Already Using? (List Out) What Has Their Experience Been Like? Example: I've taken CBD for a couple years now. I have scoliosis and chronic back pain. It definitely helps with the pain and helps me sleep at night. What Does the Market Like About Existing Solutions? What Does the Market Dislike About Existing Solutions? Are Their Horror Stories About Existing Solutions? Does the Market Believe Existing Solution Works? If Not, Why? Curiosity: Has Someone Tried to Solve the Market's Pain Points Before In A Very Unique Way? What Was The Result? Is There A Conspiratorial Story Behind Why Old Solutions Didn't Work? Are There Any Older Attempts to Solve the Problem (Pre-1960) That Are Unique? What Happened? Were they successful but forgotten? Or were they a failure? Why? Examples: Tesla in the energy space. Big energy didn't want his solutions, he was discredited and shamed. His inventions and discoveries were thrown into the ash heap of history until now. U.S. Army tried to cure foot fungus during WWII, surgeon general was on a desperate race because troops were missing service time. Finally succeeded by using Undecylenic Acid. But today we forget how effective it is. Corruption: Is There A Belief That the Market's Pain Point Used To Not Exist, Or Used To Not Be So Bad? Is There A Belief That It's Been Recently Exacerbated By Outside Forces? If So, What Are Those Forces And What's The Reason Behind Their Presence? Examples: Obesity and diabetes being the result of Dr. Ancil Keyes. This isolated group of people doesn't struggle from whatever condition/pain point that most of us do. In America we DO suffer from this pain point. The reason why is that we are exposed to these outside forces while this isolated group isn't."
