if the entire point of AI is instruction following...

why are you not instructing AI on how to instruct itself?

why write out a fresh prompt every time when one of your models can generate better ones for you based off your pre-determined conditions?

when using AI to build websites...

you can go to claude, then ask it to take your screenshot + idea on what you want to add

& create clear-cut instructions that an AI website generator like bolt new will clearly understand

now you've got a prompt that helps you effectively prompt lol
