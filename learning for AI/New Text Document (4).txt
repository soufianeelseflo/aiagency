the #1 skill required to run a successful AI automation agency isn't even automation...

it's understanding how businesses operate & the problems they face

automating workflows is challenging when you hardly understand their purpose

it's the same story as devs trying to create B2B software without having ever ran a business, in 99.9% of cases they'll fail...

technical skills are only one part of the puzzle...

hence why the "visionary + builder" duo is arguably the best combo possible - one understands the game & has a vision, the other brings it to life

AI automation sounds intimidating but it's stupidly easy...

all you need is a baseline understanding of the following things:

- workflow automation tools like n8n
- data structures (JSON)
- prompt engineering
- conditional logic
- API requests
- webhooks

& now you can charge companies thousands of $ to build AI agents lol
